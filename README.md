# Ansible Demos

Here are all the [plays](plays) and [roles](roles) I use in my many varieties of Ansible demo.

There aren't any instructions, per se, as this is all simply reference material. There will be a link to a demo recording here very soon. That demo will also reference these plays and roles.

Quite often I am working with [dynamic inventory](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_dynamic_inventory.html) sources. I've not put the scripts here, as they change. The best place to get them is from [the Ansible source](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/tree/devel/contrib/inventory) itself.
